# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It serves as a foundational blueprint for designing, analyzing, and structuring requirements before any code is written.

## 📘 Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how to gather, define, and document software requirements.
- Differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements.
- Learn how to create and interpret use case diagrams.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria for features in a booking management system.

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering program**, under the *FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint* module.

## 🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining what a software system must accomplish before development begins.  
It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, ensuring that the final product meets user needs, business goals, and technical expectations.

During this phase, stakeholders — such as clients, users, developers, and project managers — collaborate to understand the system’s purpose, scope, and functionality. The insights gathered are then transformed into clear, structured documentation that guides the rest of the development process.

### ✳️ Key Points:
- It helps uncover *what users truly need*, not just what they say they want.  
- It sets the direction for design, development, and testing.  
- It reduces misunderstandings, rework, and project risks.  
- It acts as a bridge between stakeholders’ vision and developers’ execution.

In essence, Requirement Analysis defines the **“what”** of a project before the **“how”** — ensuring clarity, alignment, and successful delivery.
