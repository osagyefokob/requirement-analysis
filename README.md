# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It serves as a foundational blueprint for designing, analyzing, and structuring requirements before any code is written.

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how to gather, define, and document software requirements.
- Differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements.
- Learn how to create and interpret use case diagrams.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria for features in a booking management system.

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering program**, under the *FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint* module.
