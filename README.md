# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It serves as a foundational blueprint for designing, analyzing, and structuring requirements before any code is written.

## üìò Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how to gather, define, and document software requirements.
- Differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements.
- Learn how to create and interpret use case diagrams.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria for features in a booking management system.

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering program**, under the *FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint* module.

## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining what a software system must accomplish before development begins.  
It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, ensuring that the final product meets user needs, business goals, and technical expectations.

During this phase, stakeholders ‚Äî such as clients, users, developers, and project managers ‚Äî collaborate to understand the system‚Äôs purpose, scope, and functionality. The insights gathered are then transformed into clear, structured documentation that guides the rest of the development process.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Key Points:
- It helps uncover *what users truly need*, not just what they say they want.  
- It sets the direction for design, development, and testing.  
- It reduces misunderstandings, rework, and project risks.  
- It acts as a bridge between stakeholders‚Äô vision and developers‚Äô execution.

In essence, Requirement Analysis defines the **‚Äúwhat‚Äù** of a project before the **‚Äúhow‚Äù** ‚Äî ensuring clarity, alignment, and successful delivery.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is not a single step ‚Äî it‚Äôs a structured process with distinct activities that ensure all stakeholder needs are accurately captured and translated into actionable insights.  

Here are the five key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the initial stage where stakeholders‚Äô needs, ideas, and expectations are collected through interviews, surveys, observation, and meetings. The goal is to understand *what the users want* and *why they want it.*

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  At this stage, the gathered information is refined and explored in depth. Techniques like brainstorming sessions, workshops, prototyping, and use cases help clarify ambiguous or conflicting requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  The findings are organized into formal documents such as the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), use case diagrams, and user stories. These serve as reference points for developers and stakeholders.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  The documented requirements are analyzed to identify dependencies, priorities, and potential challenges. Modeling tools (like flowcharts, data models, and use case diagrams) help visualize how different components of the system interact.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  This is the final activity, where requirements are reviewed and confirmed by stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and feasibility. Validation prevents costly misunderstandings later in development.

In short, these activities transform abstract ideas into a concrete roadmap ‚Äî the **bridge between vision and execution.**

## üß© Types of Requirements

In software projects, requirements are generally categorized into two main types: **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements.  
Both are essential to ensure the system not only *works* but also *performs* effectively.

### üîπ Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define *what the system should do* ‚Äî the specific features, functions, and behaviors that fulfill user and business needs.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users can register, log in, and log out securely.  
- A host can add, edit, or delete property listings.  
- Guests can search for properties based on location, price, and date.  
- The system should allow users to book, modify, or cancel reservations.  
- Confirmation emails should be sent automatically after successful booking.

These requirements describe **actions and operations** ‚Äî the ‚Äúdoing‚Äù part of the system.

---

### üî∏ Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe *how the system should perform* rather than *what it should do.*  
They ensure quality, usability, and performance standards are met.

**Examples for the same Booking Management System:**
- The website should load within **2 seconds** on a stable internet connection.  
- The system must handle **at least 5,000 concurrent users** without crashing.  
- User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.  
- The interface should be **mobile-responsive** and accessible on all major browsers.  
- The system should maintain **99.9% uptime** monthly.

Non-functional requirements focus on **performance, reliability, security, scalability, and user experience** ‚Äî the ‚Äúhow well‚Äù part of the system.

Together, both requirement types form the full picture:  
Functional requirements define **capability**, while non-functional requirements define **quality.**
